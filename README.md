# Flutter_TaskManager

Objective
Build a module that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) items
(e.g., notes, tasks, or products). This will help you understand API integration,
local data persistence, UI updates, and basic app architecture in Flutter.
Requirements
Define a data model for the item (e.g., Task with title, description, status,
created date, and priority).
Implement UI screens for listing, adding, editing, and deleting items.
Integrate with RESTful APIs for retrieving and storing data on a remote server.
Implement local caching using SQLite (sqflite package) or Hive for offline
access.
Ensure the UI updates in real-time as items are modified locally or from API
responses.
Provide user feedback for actions (e.g., snackbars for success/failure).
Use the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management.
Implement proper error handling for both API and database operations.
Create a responsive UI that works on different screen sizes.
Guidance
Use a ListView or GridView to display items with appropriate item separators or
card layouts.
Implement swipe-to-delete or deletion confirmation dialogs for better UX.
Use forms with validators for add/edit operations.
Use dedicated screens for add/edit actions with proper navigation.
Organize code using a layered architecture:
Data layer (models, repositories)
Business logic layer (BLoC, services)
Presentation layer (screens, widgets)
Use the flutter_bloc package for implementing the BLoC pattern.
Consider using dependency injection for better testability.
Implement proper loading states and empty state handling.
Handle network connectivity changes appropriately.
Technical Implementation Details
Create appropriate database schemas with indexes for efficient queries.
Use transactions for operations that modify multiple records.
Implement repository pattern to abstract data sources (both local and remote).
Create API services using http or dio packages to handle network requests.
Implement error handling and retry logic for API calls.
Use JSON serialization/deserialization for API data.
Handle token-based authentication for API requests if required.
Create reusable UI components for consistency.
Add proper logging for debugging purposes.
Implement optimistic updates for better user experience.
Deliverables
Source code for the CRUD module and UI.
Integration with local storage and RESTful APIs.
